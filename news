    (define-key transient-predicate-map
      [other-window] #'transient--do-move)

- The region is now properly displayed, when using the mouse to
  select text in the menu buffer.  7c46a093

  a menu, by setting the new option ~transient-select-menu-window~.

- Added new option ~transient-navigate-to-group-descriptions~.

- Added new option ~transient-describe-menu~.

* v0.12.0    2026-01-01

- Fixed a regression when using the ~transient-value-preset~ class,
  introduced in v0.10.0.  f960acdf

- Stopped creating a new file to save an unmodified default value
  (the empty list).  3fdd8043

- Various makefile improvements. 4e6d3fc8..151622e1

- Gave up on determining function arity upfront.  6d1d8656

- Various build improvements.

* v0.11.0    2025-11-18

- At least Emacs 28.1 is required now.  Emacs 30.1 was released
  earlier this year, so we still support Emacs "oldoldstable".
  Because Emacs 28.1 was the first release that bundled this
  package, we have to keep support for that release.  d361d272

- Use my new Cond-Let package.  87fb8396..1d2710c7

- When Isearch was exited using a key that has no binding in
  ~isearch-mode-map~, then the Transient state was not resumed.

* v0.10.1    2025-10-06

- ~transient--get-savable-value~ now also functions properly when
  used while exiting the menu.  #410

* v0.10.0    2025-09-01

- Added more context-specific functions for getting the prefix's
  value and improved the documentation explaining when to use which
  function and why.  b4edb633 (See also the commit message.)

- When suffixes are being initialized, no longer drop inactive
  suffixes (inap suffixes and those on a level that is currently
  not being used).  If/when such a suffix later becomes active,
  it now uses its set or saved value; previously the default value
  would have been used.  #316, #364, #407

- The value and scope of inapt suffixes are now initialized when
  the prefix is being initialized, which is useful because they
  may later become apt.  #407

- While setting up suffixes, the suffix being setup can now access
  suffixes that have already been setup (including their values).
  #316

- After suffixes have been setup, the value of the prefix's ~value~
  slot is now made unbound, to prevent access to this potentially
  outdated value.  5bf26de9

- Added new face ~transient-inapt-argument~ and use it for arguments
  and values that are set but aren't being used because the suffix
  is currently inapt.  fed866ba

- Added new prefix slot ~remember-value~, which allows specifying
  various modes of automatically saving the current value.  #287

* v0.9.4    2025-08-01

- When using coordinates, trying to insert the same suffix into the
  same menu twice, caused it to instead be removed the second time.
  #400

* v0.9.3    2025-07-01

- Improved kludge to work around a bug in Emacs, which may cause
  a subprocess to be killed, when the user types ~C-g~, expecting
  that to quit a transient menu.  #388

- Fixed an edge-case when trying to put point on the same suffix
  after refreshing the menu.  e508e658

- Removed an unnecessary redraw, which additionally happened too
  early, before suffixes were refreshed.  #397

* v0.9.2    2025-06-09

- Fixed a regression in v0.9.0, which made it impossible to change the
  level of a suffix, if that was set inline in the prefix definition.
